Adam smith and dvivision of labout!

The father of economics, Adam Smith, coined the phrase 'Division of labour'. The concept means to use specialization of roles such that each individual is specialized in the portion of the job and working together they create a well defined product that serves the original intended use of the product. In his example of the pin factory 10 individuals work in unision with varying expertise and create an approximate 48000 pins per day. He contrasts this with the fact that of if the works performed all the work themselves then would create 20 pin per day. 

This concept was applied to software engineering with engineers specializing in different aspect of engineering. However, in the land computers, though the specialization is paramount, it is imperative that the engineer understand the suite of property and systems that define the application to determine the development dtrategy, testing strategies and the deployment strategy.

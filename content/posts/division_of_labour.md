### Specialists and generalists

The father of economics, Adam Smith, coined the phrase 'Division of labour'. The concept means to use specialization of roles such that each individual is specialized in a portion of the job and working together they create a well-defined product that serves the original intended use of the product. In his example of the pin factory, 10 individuals work in unison with varying expertise and create approximately 48,000 pins per day. He contrasts this with the fact that if the worker performed all the work themselves, then they would create 20 pins per day. 

This concept was applied to software engineering with engineers specializing in different aspects of engineering. However, in the land of computers, though the specialization is paramount, it is imperative that the engineer understand the suite of properties and systems that define the application to determine the development strategy, testing strategies and the deployment strategy.

Similar to the specialization in manufacturing, we need specialists in software engineering as well. However, in engineering rather than being specialized in your role, it is imperative that you are also a generalist in other aspects of engineering. This helps in creating and crafting software solutions that last for years with minimal operational costs. A software engineer should certainly understand the solution they build, but should also be cognizant of other aspects such as the target audience, the expected load to the system, typical user journeys, where the solution will be deployed and executed and most important of all it should be accessible to all. I truly believe that accessibility of software is vital and it should be pivotal throughout the engineering cycle.

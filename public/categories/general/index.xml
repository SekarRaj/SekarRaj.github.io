      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;specialists-and-generalists&#34;&gt;Specialists and generalists&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The father of economics, Adam Smith, coined the phrase &amp;lsquo;Division of labour&amp;rsquo;. The concept means to use specialization of roles such that each individual is specialized in a portion of the job and working together they create a well-defined product that serves the original intended use of the product. In his example of the pin factory, 10 individuals work in unison with varying expertise and create approximately 48,000 pins per day. He contrasts this with the fact that if the worker performed all the work themselves, then they would create 20 pins per day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
